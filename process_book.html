            Internet has become an integral part of modern life. As we take advantage of the conveniences that the digital age offers,
            we are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cybercrimes such as fraud and identity theft. Inspired by the recent data breach
            incident from Equinfax that affected over 143 million people in the United States and a
            <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">
                visualization of company data breach cases</a>, we would like to investigate and understand
            the increasingly serious issues with data breaches, use visualizations to raise the public’s awareness in monitoring the safety
            of their personal data, and offer proactive approaches in cybersecurity protection.
            <br>
            <br>
            The project is consisted of 4 main parts: We begin by describing the rise of the Internet age and transitioning to a
            brief background of hackers and why they hack. Subsequently, we show selected incidents of company data breaches to make the
            point that the data we implicitly entrust to companies are susceptible to cyberattacks. The consequences of these data breaches
            are often cybercrimes on an individual level, so we follow up by visualizing identity theft trends and the time needed to resolve
            it. Lastly, we aim to make suggestions on creating a safer online existence.

                    Most of the datasets are fairly clean, so we performed minimal data cleaning in this step.

                    However, many of the datasets came in the form of .xlsx files with multiple excel sheets per data file, which
                    we converted into .csv or .json files. We also implemented a python script ("WorldBankDataParse.py" in the
                    data/internet-use folder) to parse data from
                    <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS" target="_blank">the World Data Bank</a> into .csv files.

        <h1 class="text-center">Design Evolution</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">Here, we present the design evolution of each of our 10 visualizations, which are grouped into 6 composite
            visualizations. As you will see, many of the visualizations underwent drastic re-designs which are aimed to achieve a balance between
            story telling and visual effect. </p>
        <div class="container" id="vis-1-evolution">
            <h2> Visualization 1 - Internet usage </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">The major point we wanted to make with this visualization is that internet
                had taken over the world very quickly since its commercialization in 1995. In the initial design, we hope
                to achieve this by using a set of graphs that displayed the trend in different perspectives.</p>
            <h3> Initial design </h3>
            <div class="text-center">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img src="img/process_book/internet_usage_design1.png" height="300px">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img src="img/process_book/internet_usage_design2.png" height="200px">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3> Final design </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">We felt that the initial design, while capable of conveying our point that
            internet usage had grown tremendously, line and bar charts are not very eye-catching serving as the very first
            visualization of the project. Therefore, we gathered additional data from the Wrold Data Bank in order to
            be able to plot a choropleth. We also enabled more interactivity by introducing animation and buttons to
            switch views. The linear growth in the line chart, coupled with the darkening map, tell a much more convincing
            story than the previous design.</p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="img/process_book/internet_usage_final_design.png" width="1000px">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="vis-2-evolution">
            <h2>Visualization 2 - About hackers</h2>
            <h3>Initial design</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This is one of the visualizations for which we not only changed the design, but we
                completely changed the content. Originally, the designed
            story flow was to visualize various online activities and compare their potential for exposing the user
            to cybersecurity threats. The design sketch is shown below.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="img/process_book/online_activities_design1.png" height="200px">
            </div>

            <p>However, we felt that bar charts are not very visually exciting and at the same time, we came across a hackers survey
            that we find interesting and informative. We thought giving some insight into why and how hackers came to be
            is a better transition to discussing cybersecurity issues since we wouldn't be nearly as worried about cybersecurity if
            there weren't any hackers.</p>
            <h3>Second design</h3>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="img/process_book/hacker_vis_design1.png" width="1000px">
            </div>

            <p>This design allows the user to hover over the reasons donut chart to read more about the reasons why
            hackers hack. It also allows the user to hover over the pie charts to see the results of 3 interesting
            survey questions that revealed just how easy it is for hackers to hack into a system and how most hackers feel sympathetic/
            empathetic to other hackers who have been arrested. <br>
            <br>
            One problem with this design was the coloring of the pie charts. The colors represent one category of response
            from the survey, but they do not reflect the message in the annotations. For instance, 88% of hackers can break into
            a system in less than 12 hours denotes the sum of 3 answers (0-2 hours, 2-6 hours and 6-12 hours). Therefore,
            we decided to color the pie charts to reflect the message rather than simply color each response with a different shade. This resulted
            in the final design as shown below.</p>

            <h3>Final design</h3>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="img/process_book/hacker_vis_final_design.png" width="1000px">
            </div>

            <p>In the final design, we also animated the appearance of the charts and annotations to direct the focus of the readers
            to the relevant elements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="vis-3-evolution">
            <h2>Visualization 3 - Data breach cases - Stacked Area/Bubble Chart</h2>
            <h3>Initial design</h3>
            <p>The goal of this visualization is to visualize the overall trend of data breach cases, and also allow more detailed cross-section
            views of the cases by clicking certain area of the stacked area chart, or referring to the bubble chart in the right.</p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="img/process_book/data_breach_vis_1_design1.png" height="300px">
            </div>

            <h3>Final design</h3>
            <p>We preserved most of the decisions made in the initial design, with only a few tweaks. As we developed the visualization, we realized that in the
                bubble chart, the variables which are mapped to the y-axis and size, actually have the same values in the data. Essentially, we only have one dimension
                to visualize. We tackled this problem by modifying the y-axis to the index of individual breach cases. So essentially we are stacking breach cases into
                pillars, with the size of the circle indicating the severity of the breach.</p>
            <p>The interactivity also worked as expected. When an area in the stacked area chart is clicked, the bubble chart will also change accordingly to reflect only
            the selected category. Both charts will also listen to the "visualize by" drop-down selection to be color-coded by different variables.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container" id="vis-4-evolution">
            <h2>Visualization 4 -Data breach cases - Parallel Coordinates</h2>
            <h3>Initial design</h3>
            <p>This chart uses the same data as Visualization 3, but presents the data in a fundamentally different way. A parallel coordinate chart is a great way for
            readers to explore the dataset with a whole set of interactions. They can select how many axes are plotted, brush on individual axes to filter categories, and
            click on axis title to color the lines by the selected axis.</p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="img/process_book/data_breach_vis_2_design1.png" height="300px">
            </div>
            <h3>Final design</h3>
            <p>The changes we made mainly lie in the animation. In our testing iterations, we received some feedback regarding this graph being too cluttered without a key message.
            Some also reflected that they were not sure how to use the visualization. Therefore, we decided to adopt a more guided approach to introduce this visualization. The grey
            panel in the middle will contain some instructions. The whole visualization will start from a few selected views that are meant to guide the readers how to use the visualiation,
            and give them some clues regarding what kind of patterns can be revealed by the visualization. Only after sufficient guidance is given, the plot will be turnt to the readers for
            any kind of exploration.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                One main drawback of a polar area chart is that readers will be visually drawn to the most outstanding 3-4 slices
                and will potentially skip over the smaller slices. Especially when we have 50 states to visualize,
                the polar area chart might not be the most suitable type of graph. <br>
                <br>
                For this reason, we redesigned the visualization and used a modified version of a choropleth chart instead.
                In this design, we represent each state not based on its actual geographical shape but squares with uniform areas.
                This removed the effect of states’ varying sizes might have on how readers will comprehend the graph.
                <br>
                <br>
                By clicking on to each area, a line chart and table corresponding to the state would be displayed to the right of the map to see the trend over the years for the selected state.

            <h3>Final design</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Having implemented the second design, we realized that having a map, a line chart and a table on the same page is a bit overwhelming visually.
                The line chart and table also serve the same purpose. Therefore, we decided to implement the line chart as a tooltip, appearing on mouseover, and remove the table altogether.
                This created a much cleaner view that allows the user to focus on the spatial distribution first, and then drill down to temporal distribution of specific states.

                The main point of this visualization is to show the distribution of the time needed to resolve identity
                theft cases. To avoid ending the project with a rather conventional form of visualization, we wanted to capture audience's interest by
                implementing an interactive/game-like visualization that contain some randomness.

            <h3>Second design</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                After consulting with our TF, Zona, we felt that it was best for us to come up with an original design that could end
                the visualization on a high note. The idea that
                we finally settled on was a grid of squares where the user would be prompted to click. The click would then trigger
                a series of animation to reveal a color that represents a category of time spent on resolving the identity theft. The color
                is randomly chosen based on the distribution based on previous victims data.

            The work load of this project was split evenly across team members, and we were in constant communication

            visualizations), each member also had focus areas, and they are

            We hope that you have not only enjoyed our interactive visualizations but also learned something interesting and practical about
            protecting your personal cyber space. It has been tremendously fun to apply what we've learned in CS171 and to explore beyond
            what was taught. Creating complex interactive visualizations and designing both user-friendly and visually appealing website were
            by no means easy tasks, but it was a great learning journey, and we feel very satisfied with what we've achieved as a team.
